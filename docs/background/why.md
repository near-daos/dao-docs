# Why join or start a DAO?

DAOs empower communities to govern on-chain activity, make united decisions, and interact with other DAOs. Ultimately, DAOs unlock an unprecedented level of transparent and collaborative coordination with built-in tools to allow for:

- Transparency and legitimacy via built-in reporting
- Community ownership through stakeholder participation
- Responsible fund distribution through openness and transparency which results in meaningful accountability

# Work Revolution

With hundreds of weekly active DAOs on NEAR it's easy to connect with like minded, forward thinking individuals. By coming together in this new way of organizing we are part of an amazing work revolution!
