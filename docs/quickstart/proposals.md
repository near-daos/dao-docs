Proposals are the mechanism DAOs use to get everything and anything done. Everything from changing the DAO logo to releasing funds from the DAO requires a proposal.

When you use NEAR as an individual user, each action you take on the chain requires your digital signature. The same is true for any action you want to take as a DAO. The difference is that as an individual you can click "approve" in your wallet. With a DAO, you would instead make a proposal. When the proposal passes, it's the same as if you had hit "approval". 

There are two main permissions which are relvant to proposals. First is the ability to create proposals, second is the ability to vote on proposals. We'll get into granular details around possible configurations in another section. 

# How to Make a Proposal

If you logged into Astro the "My Feeds" page has a button with a + sign on it. Hitting that is the first step to proposal creation. You can also navigate into a DAO and if you have permission to create proposals in the DAO, you will find another green + button.
