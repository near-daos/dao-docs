# Introduction

Astro is a no-code DAO-launcher on NEAR Protocol. It's home to thousands of people organizing themselves in hundreds of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. Under the hood Astro is powered by the Sputnik smart contracts. 

## Key Features

**DEMOCRATIC BY DEFAULT ðŸ ž** Decisions like distributing funds, and adding members happen through an intuitive and transparent voting process.

**SHARED TREASURY ðŸ ž** Funds are held in a treasury and are always distributed through a community-defined process.

**FLEXIBLE GOVERNANCE ðŸ ž** Who votes and how it works can be precisely configured to meet a communityâ€™s preferred operating style.
